# IT Industry Challenges 
Goals:
- How a systems department works and different models that I have found so far and vision of the possible roles that systems specialists play in companies.
- What are the possible futures of systems specialists (DevOps, SRE, Kubernetes, etc.), and how is the world of infrastructure evolving to face different challenges. (A booming industry indeed). This direction that the market is taking is in order to overcome different challenges and adapt to new needs.
- During the talk I will try to emphasize that OpenSource has revolutionized and is revolutionizing this entire world.
- The importance of the GSX subject since it provides a good base knowledge to start a career in the world of infrastructure. For example, it is impossible to be an SRE or Kubernetes specialist without a strong knowledge of systems and networks, since this is the basis.

# 1. Sysadmin in the real world
Systems administration is the field of work in which someone manages one or more systems, be they software, hardware, servers, or workstations. Its goal is to ensure that systems work efficiently and effectively.

There are different specialities (some examples):
- DBA
- Network sysadmin
- Security admin
- Technical support staff
- System admin
- Hardware (datacenter people)

The following lists illustrates an example of the tasks a system administrator can work:
- Daily system/software checks.
- Making data backups.
- Application of operating system updates and configuration changes.
- Installation and configuration of new hardware/software.
- Add/delete/create/modify user account information, reset passwords, etc.
- Answer technical queries.
- Responsibility for security.
- Responsibility for documenting the system configuration and architecture of the different solutions.
- Troubleshooting of any reported issues or reported issues.
- System performance tuning.
- Keep the network running. (corporate network, VPN, DNS, DHCP, etc.)

Without a resilient infrastructure, fault-tolerant, high availability, adjusted to the needs of consumers (developers), monitoring and alerts, developers' applications could not function.

The main goal of being a sysadmin is to be as lazy as possible. Not lazy in the sense that you don't work, but lazy in the sense that you make the computer do the hard, repetitive work, and you do the thinking work.

In this link you can find an example on some of the requirements to become a system administrator: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/?currentJobId=3047489497

Important technologies (traditionally):
- Linux.
- Network skills. (HTTP, TCP, udp, dns, dhcpd, sshd, IPAM, etc)
- Cloud.
- Databases.
- Containers.
- Observability.
- Continuous integration / Continuos Delivery.
- Windows (Windows AD, domain controller).

It's good to know a little about various runtimes for example the JVM, python, golang, php, etc.

Troubleshooting skill is extremely important.

We could possibly split the responsibilities of a system admin in three different groups:
1. **Operational work**. Attend customer requests, for example:
  - Create DNS records
  - System patching and reboot
  - Remove or create resources in hypervisors or cloud providers
  - Network ACL
  - Troubleshooting
2. **Engineering work**. Deliver new infrastructure offerings, for example:
  - Automate operational tasks.
  - Deliver new DNS solution
  - Implement a new technological solution.
3. **Training**. It is vital to keep up to date, there are many interesting sysadmin certs out there, for example:
  - https://www.redhat.com/es/services/training-and-certification
  - https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/
  - https://www.elastic.co/es/training/
  - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html
  
    You have to be up to date and expand in different fields of knowledge. The more things you know, the more value it adds to you and the better you can define your path as a technician.
    Official certifications, from Red Hat, other manufacturers or CNCF.
