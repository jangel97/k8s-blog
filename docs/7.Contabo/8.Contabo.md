# Contabo

Contabo is the cloud provider to contain and run our infrastructure. 

Contabo is not very ortodox in some aspects of its design, specially its network.
All the nodes in contabo have a public IP address. 

We modified the dns primary servers so they used the bastion.blog to resolve the dns.
